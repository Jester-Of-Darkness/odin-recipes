# Odin Recipes

This is a learning project that involves building a website about recipes using HTML. The purpose of the project is to understand/reinforce the basics of HTML as well as some best practices too. The skills I have demonstrated are;-

1. Using href to link pages together
2. Using image source tags to add images to the website as well as an alt attribute for people with screen readers and disabilities
3. Using the target atrribute for additional security
4. Setup and cloning of a new GitHub repository using SSH
5. Using Git commands such as `git add` to add and `git commit` to commit changes to the main repository branch
