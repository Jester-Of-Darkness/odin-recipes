                <p>This is an easy homemade lasagne that can be prepared ahead of time and saved in the freezer, uncooked, for when you need it. Bake for an extra 45 mins</p>
                
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 olive oil plus extra for the dish</li>
                    <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
                    <li>800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce</li>
                    <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
                    <li>300g fresh lasagne sheets</li>
                    <li>white sauce (find a recipe in the method, or use shop-bought)</li>
                    <li>125g ball mozzarella torn into thin strips</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Method</h2>

                    <h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>
                        <p>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two seperate batches for about 10 mins until the mince meat is brown.</p>
    
                    <h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>
                        <p>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Season to taste.</p>
    
                    <h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>
                        <p>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</p>
        
                    <h3><strong>Step 4</strong></h3>
                        <p>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</p>

                    <h3><strong>Step 5</strong></h3>
                        <p>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made white sauce.</p>
                        <p>Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you can't see any pasta poking through.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Step 6</strong></h3>
                        <p>Put 125g of the torn mozzarella over the top.</p>
                        <p>Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and golden brown.</p>
